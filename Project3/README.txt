TO COMPILE:
	run the command 'make'

TO RUN: 
	run the command './project3 [trace level]'

Simulates distance vector protocol in finding the shortest path from node A to B.
A clean printing program should be run at trace level 1. A debugging program should
be run at trace level 2

All displayed times are in milliseconds and are relative to when that node's init 
function is called (as opposed to some global start time for the whole program)
